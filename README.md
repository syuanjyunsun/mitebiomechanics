We explored the spatial niche partitioning between two phoretic mite, Poecilochirus carabi and Macrocheles nataliae, that coexist on the host burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. We further provided evidence with biomechanic approaches to reveal the underlying adaptive values of attachment to beetle's cuticle surface.
