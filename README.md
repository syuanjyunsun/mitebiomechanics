We explored the spatial niche partitioning between two phoretic mite, Poecilochirus carabi and Macrocheles nataliae, that coexist on the host burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. We further provided evidence with biomechanic approaches to reveal the underlying adaptive values of attachment to beetle's cuticle surface. We first surveyed the natural densities of mites on field-collected beetles, and determined their preferred attachment sites on beetles. Next, we manipulated densities of both mites to investigate how intra- and inter-specific interactions influenced mite spatial distribution. Using electron microscopy, we quantified the cuticle surface of all beetle body parts and mite attachment devices. To further assess if mite preference for specific attachment sites is adaptive, we tested mite attachment to both beetle surface and artificial test substrates. Together, we showed that specialised mite attachment to different beetle's body parts mediate spatial niche partitioning among mite species on their carrier.
